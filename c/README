File structure:

gf/	core routines to compute in a finite field GF(2^n)
rs/	Reed-Solomon encoder + decoder
test/	test code, also useful as application example
./	user configuration file ecc_cfg.h, specifying the code parameters,
	including the size of the finite field.

Code parameters are set at compile time.

Tab width is 4 (shoot me...)
