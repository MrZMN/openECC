Here I share implementations of Error Correction Codes (ECCs) (well, only one so
far) I am working on with some passion.

As of 2012-03-19, it contains:

- Generic Reed-Solomon codec
  Implemented in C, using the Euclidian algorithm for decoding.  As usual, it
  claims to be *super* fast and *extremely* small, but I'll add some real data
  here one day.

BCH and others may follow, maybe even some VHDL versions.
