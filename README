Here I share implementations of Error Correction Codes (ECCs) (well, only one so
far) I am working on with some passion.

Currently it contains:

- Generic, very fast Reed-Solomon codec in C:

  o 2 to 3x faster than the RS-codec of the Linux kernel (as of 3.2.6).  Corner
    cases could gain up to 90x.  Not (yet) offering the same flexibility,
    though.  The speed gain only partially results from this codec's static
    configuration (the Linux codec uses dynamic configuration).  See the
    benchmark branches for details.

  o Uses the Euclidean algorithm for decoding, as described in an awesome book
    about finite fields by Hans Kurzweil (D).


BCH or other codecs may follow one day, VHDL versions will be added the day
after...
